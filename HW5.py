# HW3 Review: Data Types + Functions + Conditionals + Loops

# 2.1 Data Types
#def checkDataType(input):
   # return str(type(input).__name__)

# Test cases
#print(checkDataType(3.14))  # 'float'
#print(checkDataType(True))  # 'bool'


# 2.2 Conditionals
#def evenOrOdd(num):
    #if num % 2 == 0:
      #  return "Even"
   # else:
   #     return "Odd"

# Test cases
#print(evenOrOdd(7))  # 'Odd'
#print(evenOrOdd(10))  # 'Even'


# 3 Loops
#def sumWithLoop(numbers):
    #total = 0
    #for number in numbers:
       # total += number
   # return total

# Test case
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#print(sumWithLoop(numbers))  # 15
